## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size



## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I Learned

This project helped me improve my skills in responsive design using Flexbox and CSS Grid. I also got hands-on experience with designing a mobile-first layout and implementing a solution that adapts to various screen sizes.

**Code Example:**

```html
<div class="card">
  <h2>Card Title</h2>
  <p>Card content goes here</p>
</div>
```

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #fff;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus on improving my knowledge of CSS Grid and working with animations and transitions to make the user experience even better. I also aim to refine my React skills and experiment with more advanced features.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) - A great resource for learning CSS Grid and Flexbox.
